Test duration : 45min.

Problem:
For a given a string like  "inventory:45,assembly:104, supply:203, manufacturing:305” 
You should have two arrays where one array will have  string elements like inventory, assembly,  supply,  etc...
and second array will have 45,104, 203  etc... and throw an error if the two parameters have different lengths

Thanks,
